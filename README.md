# Group 8 - Project One

This project does not use node and thus does not require any special use of tools to run.

## Starting the application

If you have not installed yarn, do not fear, just follow the link to the [Zodiac and Horoscope finder](https://shruti2648.github.io/project_one_boiler/).

* Windows and Mac Users: Install Chrome for best user experience [here](https://www.google.com/chrome/).

## Using The Application

The first time you see the website, it might seem like it is too simple but put your mind at ease, this application is as simple and easy as it seems.

Without any work needed, the user will be able to see all of the zodiacs signs strength, weaknesses, likes and dislikes.
By using the date form, the user can enter his or her birthday and after some heavy calculating using complex algorithms the users zodiac daily horoscope will appear like magic.

## Folder and file Structure

```
index.html <- html file for application UI
 --css <- css file lives here
 --javascript <- the javascript file with back-end logic lives here
 --images <- images used on teh app are stored here
...
```
For purposes of this project working, please do not change file names or folder locations.
